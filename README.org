#+TITLE: Affix

* Status

  Not suitable for use, production or otherwise.

* Overview

  The affix iterator is conceptually similar to the
  std::ostream_iterator. However, rather just specifying an value that
  is injected into the stream after each item, the affix iterator
  allows prefix, infix and suffix values to be injected into the stream.
  
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
std::vector<int> xs = {1, 2, 3, 4};
std::copy( begin( xs ), end( xs ), affix::affix_iterator<int>( std::cout, "{", ",", "}" ));
// 
// => {1,2,3,4}
//
#+END_SRC

* Outstanding Issues

  The suffix decoration is injected into the output stream upon
  destruction of the affix_iterator.  It is not clear that that is a
  reasonable/reliable way for the suffix to be injected.
